# Logging-Framework
A scalable, secure, and async logging framework with log rotation, contextual logging, AWS CloudWatch, S3 &amp; MongoDB support, and sensitive data masking for efficient debugging and monitoring. 

Enhancements & Use Case of the Logging System 
I have built a production-grade logging framework with the following enhancements:

ðŸ”¹ Enhancements Added
âœ… Log Rotation (Auto-delete old logs)

Uses TimedRotatingFileHandler to rotate logs daily and auto-delete old logs based on backupCount.

Helps manage log size without manual cleanup.

âœ… Django Middleware (Logs API requests/responses)

Captures incoming requests, execution time, and outgoing responses.

Useful for tracking API performance and debugging issues.

âœ… Contextual Logging (User ID, Function Name, Execution Time)

Adds user ID, function name, and execution time for better traceability.

Helps debug errors efficiently with precise context.

âœ… Async Logging (Boosts Performance)

Uses ThreadPoolExecutor to log messages asynchronously.

Ensures logging doesn't block API requests, making the app faster.

âœ… AWS CloudWatch, S3 & MongoDB (For Centralized Logging)

Logs can be stored in AWS CloudWatch, S3, and MongoDB for better monitoring.

Useful for debugging in cloud-based environments and centralized log storage.

âœ… Security Features (Sensitive Data Masking)

Masks sensitive information like passwords and emails in logs.

Prevents security leaks in logs.

ðŸ”¹ Use Cases & Benefits
ðŸ”¸ Microservices & Distributed Systems

Centralized logging (AWS, MongoDB, S3) helps in tracking logs across services.

ðŸ”¸ Real-time Monitoring & Debugging

CloudWatch logs help in tracking live production issues.

ðŸ”¸ Performance Optimization & Profiling

Capturing execution time in middleware helps identify slow API endpoints.

ðŸ”¸ Data Security & Compliance

Log masking ensures that sensitive user data isnâ€™t leaked in logs.

ðŸ”¸ Scalability & Maintainability

Auto log rotation ensures logs donâ€™t overload the system.

âœ… Summary
I built a high-performance, scalable, and secure logging system for local and cloud-based environments.
This setup ensures efficient debugging, security, and performance monitoring while following best practices!
